Time Series Modeling and Forecasting of Tourist Arrivals in Sri Lanka using SARIMAX Model

This project models and forecasts monthly tourist arrivals in Sri Lanka (2015–2025) using SARIMAX and GARCH models in R. It incorporates COVID-19 indicators and exchange rate as exogenous variables to account for external impacts on tourism patterns.

The R workflow includes data preprocessing (handling missing values), time series decomposition, stationarity checks, and modeling with SARIMAX to capture seasonality and external influences. Residual diagnostics, including autocorrelation, normality, and heteroscedasticity tests, ensure model reliability. A GARCH(1,1) model is applied to residuals to capture time-varying volatility. Forecasts are generated and compared with actual data, providing insights for tourism stakeholders to make informed decisions in dynamic conditions.
